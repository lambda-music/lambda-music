# How to Compile Lambda Music Sequencer #
Lamu is developed by Eclipse. The `workspace` directory in the repository is an  
workspace directory of Eclipse. In most time, opening the workspace directory 
by Eclipse should compile the entire project automatically and can be executed 
on Eclipse. It is suffice for writing code and testing the code.

The executable JAR file can  be built by ANT build file on `build` directory.

Currently there are six projects under Lamu's workspace. The following list is
the relation of dependency among the projects in Lamu.

```memo
- lib
- kawapad
    +>lib
- metro 
    +-> lib
- pulsar 
    +-> lib
    +-> metro
    +-> kawapad
- lamu
    +-> lib
    +-> kawapad
    +-> pulsar
    +-> lamu
```

# Compilation by Ant #
`[workspace]/build/build.xml` is a ANT build file which was generated by
Eclipse. This builds `lamu.jar`.

# Main Class #
The main-class is `lamu.LamuApplication`.
