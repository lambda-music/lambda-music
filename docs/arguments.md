Lamu Command-line Parameter Reference
======================================

Lamu command-line parameter has two modes: `default-mode` and `advanced-
mode`. If the first argument is 'advanced', Lamu processes the arguments
in the `advanced-mode`; otherwise Lamu processes them as `default-mode`.

In this section, it presumes that the knowledge for the architecture of Lamu.
Please also read the description at [The architecture of 
Lamu](./architecture.md).

# Command-line Parameter in Default-Mode #

```bash
lamu [filename]
```

This demonstrates how to start the new Lamu application instance in the 
default-mode. The filename argument is optional. If the filename argument is 
given, then the Lamu's main-editor opens the specified file.

This Lamu's default behavior can be customised. The way how to customize the 
behavior is described later. 

# Command-line Parameter in Advanced-Mode #
Lamu consists a number of components and its command-line parameter can specify 
which components to be instantiated at boot-time. 

For example, Lamu has a HTTP server component which enables remote clients to 
execute Scheme command on the server where Lamu is running. And Lamu also has a 
HTTP client component which enables accessing to the HTTP server. The Lamu's 
advanced-mode command-line parameter can specify how Lamu should run.

In order to enable the advanced-mode of command-line parameter, add a keyword 
`advanced` in front of other arguments. 

```bash
> lamu advanced ([create|fork|load|...]) ([argument]...)
```

Currently, there are three commands available:

- `create`
  Specify components to be instantiated.

- `fork`
  Execute external commands.

- `echo`
  Print the specified message.

- `load`
  Load the arguments from the specified file.

# `create` Command #
The `create` command specifies which component to be instantiated. For example:

```bash
> lamu advanced create scheme + pulsar + gui +
```

The above is an example which demonstrates how to use `create` command.  This 
example instantiates a Scheme engine, a Pulsar instance and a GUI frame.  They 
are the most basic set of components in Lamu. Note that the every component 
name is separated by keyword `+`.  These `+` tokens separates sections. Each 
section contains one or more arguments. The first argument denotes the name of 
the components to be instantiated and others are arguments for the component.

```bash
> lamu advanced create scheme + pulsar + gui /path/to/file.scm +
```

The above is an example which executes Lamu with the basic set of the 
components, and then the main editor opens the specified file 
`/path/to/file.scm`.  Note that the every region which is separated by `+` 
tokens contains multiple elements. And the first element of a region
denotes the name of the component to instantiate.

The available components are explained later.


# Multi-Line Arguments #
Lamu's advanced commands sometimes become very long. It is recommended to split
the commands when they come to certain length by using Shell's escape sequence 
character as:

Before:
```bash
> lamu advanced create scheme + pulsar + gui /path/to/file.scm +
```

After:
```bash
> lamu advanced \
    create scheme + pulsar + \
    gui /path/to/file.scm
```

# Multi-Statements #
In advanced-mode, it is able to pass two or more commands at once. Let's call 
it `multi-statements`.

```bash
> lamu advanced \
    begin \
        create scheme + pulsar + gui + \
    end \
    begin \
        create scheme + pulsar + gui \
    end \
```

The above is an example to demonstrate how to use multiple-statements in the 
advanced-mode. Note that there are two keywords : `begin` and `end`. Commands 
which surrounded by `begin` and `end` becomes a statement. 

This creates two distinctive Scheme engines and then connect a Scheme editor to 
each in a same JVM. That is, both editor has its own variable scope. This usage 
is explained later.


# `fork` Command #
The `fork` command invokes a new JVM instance and loads Lamu with
the specified arguments. Its primary usage is to configure Lamu
in client-server mode. See the following example:

```bash
> lamu advanced \
    begin \
        fork lamu advanced create scheme + pulsar + http --port=8193 \
    end \
    begin \
        create scheme --http=http://localhost:8193 + kawapad song.scm \
    end \
```
The above is an example to invoke and configure Lamu in HTTP client-server mode. 

Lamu can run in client-server mode. A Java editor is sometimes a burden for 
the garbage collection and obstructs JACKAudio's real-time processing. This 
causes unpredictable skips on the generated sound.  Therefore, Kawapad is 
designed that to be able to be separately executed in another JVM.

# Nested Multiple-Statements #
Multiple-statements can be nested; a typical scenario of the usage of 
multiple-statement is using with `fork` command.

```bash
> lamu advanced \
    begin \
        create scheme --server-port=8193 + kawapad + \
    end \
    begin \
        fork lamu advanced \
        begin \
            create scheme + http --port=8193 + \
        end \
        begin \
            create scheme + kawapad \
        end \
    end \
```

Note that `fork` command itself is surrounded by `begin` and `end` and its 
arguments also consist `begin` and `end`; this example works as expected.

# `echo` Command #
Print the specified message.
```bash
> lamu advanced echo HELLO WORLD FOO BAR!
```

This command causes `HELLO WORLD FOO BAR!` to be printed.


# `load` Command #
Lamu can execute external files as command-line arguments.
This file is called Lamu External Argument Script.
The `load` command Load the specified file and execute it as arguments.
For example, when there is a file `foo/bar/bum.lamu` as:

```bash
advanced
begin
    echo foo bar
end
begin
    create scheme + pulsar + repl + gui $*{$}
end
begin
    echo foo bar
end
```
And then execute the file as:

```bash
> lamu advanced load foo/bar/bum.lamu
```
This causes Lamu to run with basic components with `foo bar` printed in
the standard stream.

Note that in the Lamu external argument file, multiple-line command-line are 
available without escape sequence characters.

# Dynamic Parameter in Lamu External Argument File #
Lamu External Argument File itself can accept arguments.

Create a file which name is `example.lamu` as:

```bash
advanced
begin
    echo $hello{FOO $ BAR}
end
```

And then execute the script as

```bash
advanced load 'example.lamu' --hello='HELLO WORLD' 2> /dev/null
```

This causes `FOO HELLO WORLD BAR' to be printed.


## Specification ##
```
$VARIABLE-NAME{ ANY VALUE FORMAT SPEC $ FORMAT SPEC }
```
- Any argument starts with `$` is treated as a variable.
- The alphabet characters after the `$` are treated as a name of the variable.
- When the command-line processor encounters a variable in Lamu external 
  argument script, the processor replaces it to the content of the 
  corresponding runtime-named-argument only when the corresponding 
  runtime-named-argument exists in the runtime-arguments.
  Otherwise the variable will be silently ignored.
- When there are a block which is surrounded by curly-braces after a variable,
  it is treated as a format-specification. The variable is replaced with the 
  content of the format-specification. If there is a `$` in the 
  format-specification, the `$` will be replaced with the corresponding 
  runtime-named-argument.



# Defining User Commands #
You can define new commands by creating macro-commands in the default-argument 
configuration file. The path of the configuration file is: 
`~/.lamu/default-arguments.conf` .

The following is an example of the configuration file.

```bash
default create scheme + pulsar + repl + gui $*{--open=$} +
simple create scheme + pulsar + simple-repl + gui $*{--open=$} +
cs create begin scheme --server-port=8193 + gui $* end begin scheme + pulsar + http --port=8193 end
local create scheme + pulsar + repl + gui $open{$} +
```

The first column of each line denotes the name of macro-command.

```bash
> lamu advanced local --open=/foo/bar/bum.scm
```

The above example is expanded as

```bash
> lamu advanced create scheme + pulsar + repl + gui /foo/bar/bum.scm
```

`default` macro-command can override the behavior of the default-mode 
command-line parameter.

```
default create scheme + pulsar + repl +
```

For example, setting as above makes `lamu` to execute without GUI as default.


# Lamu Component Reference #
The following is the list of available components in `create` command.

- kawapad
- pulsar
- repl
- gui
- http
- simple-repl
- logger-stream
- stdio-stream
- forked-stream
- reference
- reference-list

## `kawapad` ##
Instantiate Kawapad.
- `--server-url=[url]` specifies remote-server's URL.
- `--server-port=[port]` specifies remote-server's port. The address defaults 
  to `localhost`.

## `pulsar` ##
Instantiate Pulsar. No argument is available.

## `repl` ##
Instantiate a Scheme REPL processor. No argument is available.

## `gui` ##

## `stdio-stream` ##
Create a standard stream object and push it on the stack.

## `forked-stream` ##
Retrieve the last forked process and create a stream object from it and push it 
on the stack.

## `logger-stream` ##
A logger-stream is a stream-wrapper which intercepts the data streams and save 
them to the specified files. The intercepted data are transparently passed to 
the following stream.

When `logger-stream` is specified, the system retrieves  a stream object from 
the stack and create a logger-stream, and then push it to the stack.


## `reference` ##
Output the specified command reference.
- `--category=[category-name]` specifies the category to output.
- `--output-file=[filename]` specifies the filename to output.

## `reference-list` ##
Output the list of available command reference.
- `--output-file=[filename]` specifies the filename to output. If no output 
  file was specified, it outputs to `stdout`.


# Advanced Usage Examples #

## Instantiate Two or More Scheme Engines ##

```bash
> lamu advanced \
    begin \
        create scheme + pulsar + gui + \
    end \
    begin \
        create scheme + pulsar + gui \
    end \
```

In editor one, execute the following code.

```scheme
(define v 'hello)
(display v)
(newline)
; => hello
```
And then in editor two, execute the following code.

```scheme
(define v 'world)
(display v)
(newline)
; => world
```

Then back to the editor one, execute the following code.

```scheme
(display v)
(newline)
; => hello
```


<!--
# Command Specifier #
The first element in the command-line arguments is a command specifier. This 
can be one of `create` or `fork`. Or in fact, this can be other string literals 
too, because it can be dynamically extended by the Lamu configuration file.
The mechanism will be described later. When the string as the command specifier 
is none of `create` , `fork` nor other extended command names, the command 
specifier `default` is applied.
