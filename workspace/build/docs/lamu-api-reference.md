#### SYNOPSIS ####
    (simultaneous|simul [subproc::procedure]...)::void

### DESCRIPTION ###
executes passed the procedures "simultaneously". This procedure is designed to
add multiple tracks to the sequencer and and let the tracks start to play
simultaneously. While the interpreter is executing this procedure, the thread that is
processing tracks in order to generate the music data is blocked. Therefore, it is
guaranteed that the sequencer starts to process the added tracks simultaneously. In case
the current sequencer system has not established any connection to the JACK, it
throws an exception.



--------------------------------------------------------

GET-TRACK
====================

#### SYNOPSIS ####
    (get-track|gett [track-spec::any]...)::void

### DESCRIPTION ###
||get-track|| retrieves multiple tracks which are specified as track-spec
arguments. The tracks are stored in a linked list. See \(help about-track-spec\). In case
the current sequencer system has not established any connection to the JACK, it
throws an exception.



--------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT-TRACK-SPEC
====================

#### SYNOPSIS ####
    (about-track-spec)

### DESCRIPTION ###
The track-spec denotes a specification of a track to retrieve. Only symbol,
string and procedure are valid as a track-spec.

 When track-spec is a symbol/a string, the value is compared with the name value of each track, and the track is added to the result when it equals to the value. It uses the equals() method of java.lang.Object class to check the equality of the two values. 

When track-spec is a procedure: The system enumerates all tracks in the current
sequencer, and call the specified procedure for each track. The procedure should have two
parameters : \(lambda \( name tags \) ... \). If a track identified by the name and the
tags is not to retrieve, the procedure should return \#f; otherwise the track is
selected to the result.

In case the current sequencer system has not established any connection to the
JACK, it throws an exception.



--------------------------------------------------------

NEW-TRACK
====================

#### SYNOPSIS ####
    (new-track|newt [notations::procedure/(list notation)]...)::MetroTrack

### DESCRIPTION ###
new-track creates a new track. A track is a basic unit of music in Pulsar music
sequencer. A track contains a procedure to create a notation list. When a user added a
track to the sequencer, the sequencer asks what to play next to the track. The
sequencer plays it and asks to the track again when it finished to play the notation
list. The length of a notation list which a track creates is usually one measure; but
it can be any length. The sequencer can have multiple tracks. There is no limit on
maximum number of tracks. It is necessary to add the track which is created by
new-track procedure to the sequencer by \(put-track\) procedure. See \(help put-track\)
for further information. In case the current sequencer system has not established
any connection to the JACK, it throws an exception.

has not established any connection to the JACK, it throws an exception.



--------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT-NOTATION
====================

#### SYNOPSIS ####
    (about-notation)::void

### DESCRIPTION ###
A notation is a MIDI data which Pulsar music sequencer can play. In Pulsar, a
notation is made of a Scheme association list. There are several types of a notation
such as notes, rests, MIDI control changes and others. The contents of a notation
depend on its type; for example, if a notation is a note data, the notation object
have four properties : velocity, length, position and pitch. In case the current
sequencer system has not established any connection to the JACK, it throws an exception.

NO-NAME([]
====================

#### SYNOPSIS ####
    ( [sync-type::symbol=] [sync-track::MetroTrack|track-spec=] [sync-offset::number=])

### DESCRIPTION ###
%1$s the passed track on the sequencer. %2$s

The ||track|| parameter is the reference to the track which is to play.

The sync-type parameter can be one of ||immediate||, ||parallel|| and
||serial||.

When sync-type is ||immediate||, the sequencer starts to play the track as soon
as possible after returning from the procedure call. When sync-type is
||parallel||, the sequencer starts to play the track at the same position with the track
which is specified as ||sync-track|| parameter.

When sync-type is ||serial||, the sequencer starts to play the track right
after the track which is specified in the ||sync-track|| finished to play.

The sync-track parameter is the reference to the track which is to synchronize
with.

The sync-offset parameter is the time offset from the time that track is
supposed to start playing. The number must be a real number. It denotes the offset
length which unit is a measure-length.

NOTIFY-TRACK-CHANGE
====================

#### SYNOPSIS ####
    (notify-track-change|nott)::void

### DESCRIPTION ###
notifies the sequencer that the track was added/deleted. When any tracks are
added/deleted on the sequencer, the modification is not immediately reflects to the current
state of the sequencer. After a series of adding/deleting tracks is performed by a
user,the the user is mandated to call this procedure. This procedure notifies the
sequencer that some tracks. And calling this procedure guarantees the tracks
added/deleted on the sequencer are properly processed immediately.
