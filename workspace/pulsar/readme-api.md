of a port to create. The value can be a value of any type; thought, it is usually
a value which is easy to be distinguished such as a symbol value or a string
value. The value is applied as the identifier of the created port. A duplicated port

string and procedure are valid as a track-spec.

When track-spec is a symbol/a string, the value is compared with the name
value of each track, and the track is added to the result when it equals to the
value. It uses the equals() method of java.lang.Object class to check the equality of
the two values.

When track-spec is a procedure: The system enumerates all tracks in the current
sequencer, and call the specified procedure for each track. The procedure should have two
parameters : (lambda ( name tags ) ... ). If a track identified by the name and the tags
is not to retrieve, the procedure should return #f; otherwise the track is
selected to the result.

In case the current sequencer system has not established any connection to the
JACK, it throws an exception.

sequencer. A track contains a procedure to create a notation list. When a user added a
track to the sequencer, the sequencer asks what to play next to the track. The
sequencer plays it and asks to the track again when it finished to play the notation
list. The length of a notation list which a track creates is usually one measure; but
it can be any length. The sequencer can have multiple tracks. There is no limit on
maximum number of tracks. It is necessary to add the track which is created by
new-track procedure to the sequencer by (put-track) procedure. See (help put-track) for
further information. In case the current sequencer system has not established any
connection to the JACK, it throws an exception.

such as notes, rests, MIDI control changes and others. The contents of a notation
depend on its type; for example, if a notation is a note data, the notation object
have four properties : velocity, length, position and pitch. In case the current
sequencer system has not established any connection to the JACK, it throws an exception.



--------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT-INTRO

### DESCRIPTION ###
put the passed track on the sequencer. The sequencer starts to play the added
track and it gives the user some controls on how it starts playing the track.

The ||track|| parameter is the reference to the track which is to play.

The sync-type parameter can be one of ||immediate||, ||parallel|| and
||serial||.

When sync-type is ||immediate||, the sequencer starts to play the track as soon
as possible after returning from the procedure call. When sync-type is
||parallel||, the sequencer starts to play the track at the same position with the track
which is specified as ||sync-track|| parameter.

When sync-type is ||serial||, the sequencer starts to play the track right
after the track which is specified in the ||sync-track|| finished to play.

The sync-track parameter is the reference to the track which is to synchronize
with.

The sync-offset parameter is the time offset from the time that track is
supposed to start playing. The number must be a real number. It denotes the offset
length which unit is a measure-length.

### DESCRIPTION ###
removes the passed track on the sequencer. The sequencer remove the specified
track. Eventually the track stops playing. And it gives the user some controls on how
it stops playing the track.

The ||track|| parameter is the reference to the track which is to play.

The sync-type parameter can be one of ||immediate||, ||parallel|| and
||serial||.

When sync-type is ||immediate||, the sequencer starts to play the track as soon
as possible after returning from the procedure call. When sync-type is
||parallel||, the sequencer starts to play the track at the same position with the track
which is specified as ||sync-track|| parameter.

When sync-type is ||serial||, the sequencer starts to play the track right
after the track which is specified in the ||sync-track|| finished to play.

The sync-track parameter is the reference to the track which is to synchronize
with.

The sync-offset parameter is the time offset from the time that track is
supposed to start playing. The number must be a real number. It denotes the offset
length which unit is a measure-length.

state of the sequencer. After a series of adding/deleting tracks is performed by a
user,the the user is mandated to call this procedure. This procedure notifies the
sequencer that some tracks. And calling this procedure guarantees the tracks
added/deleted on the sequencer are properly processed immediately.

When the result value is a ||kawapad-page|| object, the value is displayed in a
special way; when the KawaPad system detect the result value is a ||kawapad-page||, the
editor expands the current selection to the outer-most parentheses and replace the
region with the result value. This enables it to use KawaPad as a dynamic Hypertext
editor.

The make-page procedure convert the passed value into the kawapad-page object
in order to activate the special display function of KawaPad. In case the current
sequencer system has not established any connection to the JACK, it throws an exception.
