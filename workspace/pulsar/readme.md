  Pulsar
==================

Pulsar is an interface of [Metro music sequencer](../metro/readme.md). Pulsar
embraces [Kawa Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/) in its heart, and
attempts to bridge the world with the sequencer.

Pulsar has an API procedure set which is called [Pulsar
API](readme-procs-api.md).  A user may use the API to build a set of notation
data. The notation data is defined in a specification which is called [Pulsar
Notation API](readme-notes-api.md).
