OPEN?
====================

#### SYNOPSIS ####
    (open?)::boolean

### DESCRIPTION ###
returns the current open state. This procedure returns #t iff the current
sequencer state is open; otherwise returns #f.



--------------------------------------------------------

OPEN
====================

#### SYNOPSIS ####
    (open client-name::string)::void

### DESCRIPTION ###
starts a new connection between JACK Audio Connection Kit. This procedure opens
a new connection to the installed JACK Audio Connection Kit withthe specified
client name. When it failed to open a connection, this throws an exception. This
procedure alters the current sequencer system's state.



--------------------------------------------------------

CLOSE
====================

#### SYNOPSIS ####
    (close)::void

### DESCRIPTION ###
ends the current connection between JACK Audio Connection Kit. This procedure
closes the current connection to the JACK Audio Connection Kit. When it failed to
close the connection, this throws an exception. In case the current sequencer system
has not established any connection to the JACK, it throws an exception. This
procedure alters the current sequencer system's state.



--------------------------------------------------------

OPEN-OUTPUT
====================

#### SYNOPSIS ####
    (open-output|openo [port-name::any|(list any ...)]...)::MetroPort

### DESCRIPTION ###
opens output ports on the current JACK connection. Each argument is the name
of a port to create. The value can be a value of any type; thought, it is usually
a value which is easy to be distinguished such as a symbol value or a string
value. The value is applied as the identifier of the created port. A duplicated port
name on the current JACK connection causes an exception to be thrown. In case the
current sequencer system has not established any connection to the JACK, it throws an
exception. This procedure alters the current sequencer system's state.



--------------------------------------------------------

OPEN-INPUT
====================

#### SYNOPSIS ####
    (open-input|openi [port-name::any|(list any ...)]...)::MetroPort

### DESCRIPTION ###
opens input ports on the current JACK connection. Each argument is the name of
a port to create. The value can be a value of any type; thought, it is usually a
value which is easy to be distinguished such as a symbol value or a string value. The
value is applied as the identifier of the created port. A duplicated port name on the
current JACK connection causes an exception to be thrown. In case the current sequencer
system has not established any connection to the JACK, it throws an exception. This
procedure alters the current sequencer system's state.

argument is a reference to a MetroPort object to close. A value which is other than a
reference to a MetroPort object is treated as an identifier of a MetroPort object and
automatically replaced with a reference value to the corresponding MetroPort object. The
value is applied as the identifier of the created port. A duplicated port name on the
current JACK connection causes an exception to be thrown. In case the current sequencer
system has not established any connection to the JACK, it throws an exception. This
procedure alters the current sequencer system's state.

reference to a MetroPort object is treated as an identifier of a MetroPort object and
automatically replaced with a reference value to the corresponding MetroPort object. The
value is applied as the identifier of the created port. A duplicated port name on the
current JACK connection causes an exception to be thrown. In case the current sequencer
system has not established any connection to the JACK, it throws an exception. This
procedure alters the current sequencer system's state.



--------------------------------------------------------

LIST-OUTPUT

manner; that is this procedure connects each port in the argument which position is in
odd ordinal number, to the port in the argument which position is in even ordinal
number.

A canonical port name consists two parts; these are separated by a semicolon
and the former part is the name of a client and the latter is the name of a port as
"a-nice-client:the-port".

disconnects the port which is specified in the first argument to the port which is
specified in the second argument. The rest arguments are also processed in the same
manner; that is this procedure disconnects each port in the argument which position is
in odd ordinal number, to the port in the argument which position is in even
ordinal number.

A canonical port name consists two parts; these are separated by a semicolon
and the former part is the name of a client and the latter is the name of a port as
"a-nice-client:the-port".

It is able to enumerate all ports by ||list-all-output|| and ||list-all-input||

add multiple tracks to the sequencer and and let the tracks start to play
simultaneously. While the interpreter is executing this procedure, the thread that is
processing tracks in order to generate the music data is blocked. Therefore, it is
guaranteed that the sequencer starts to process the added tracks simultaneously. In case
the current sequencer system has not established any connection to the JACK, it
throws an exception.

#### SYNOPSIS ####
    (about-track-spec)

### DESCRIPTION ###
The track-spec denotes a specification of a track to retrieve. Only symbol,
string and procedure are valid as a track-spec.

 When track-spec is a symbol/a string, the value is compared with the name value of each track, and the track is added to the result when it equals to the value. It uses the equals() method of java.lang.Object class to check the equality of the two values. 

When track-spec is a procedure: The system enumerates all tracks in the current
sequencer, and call the specified procedure for each track. The procedure should have two
parameters : (lambda ( name tags ) ... ). If a track identified by the name and the tags
is not to retrieve, the procedure should return #f; otherwise the track is
selected to the result.

In case the current sequencer system has not established any connection to the
JACK, it throws an exception.

sequencer. A track contains a procedure to create a notation list. When a user added a
track to the sequencer, the sequencer asks what to play next to the track. The
sequencer plays it and asks to the track again when it finished to play the notation
list. The length of a notation list which a track creates is usually one measure; but
it can be any length. The sequencer can have multiple tracks. There is no limit on
maximum number of tracks. It is necessary to add the track which is created by
new-track procedure to the sequencer by (put-track) procedure. See (help put-track) for
further information. In case the current sequencer system has not established any
connection to the JACK, it throws an exception.

--------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT-NOTATION
====================

#### SYNOPSIS ####
    (about-notation)::void

### DESCRIPTION ###
A notation is a MIDI data which Pulsar music sequencer can play. In Pulsar, a
notation is made of a Scheme association list. There are several types of a notation
such as notes, rests, MIDI control changes and others. The contents of a notation
depend on its type; for example, if a notation is a note data, the notation object
have four properties : velocity, length, position and pitch. In case the current
sequencer system has not established any connection to the JACK, it throws an exception.
