====== Bidirectional parenthesis jumping is not effective ======
Created Mon day 29 October 2018

@todo

Now parenthesis movement is done in both way; that is, if a user push down control-g when the cursor is on the opening side of  parentheses "(" , it goes to the otherside of the parentheses.  It may be more effective if the parentheses jumping is done in unidirectional.

When the cursor is on the "(", pressing Alt-Shift-Left causes going to ")", and vice versa. 

[ ] bidirectional jumping should be unidirectional.
