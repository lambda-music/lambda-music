====== Significant Property Model is Broken ======
Created Monday 05 November 2018

===== About Inefficiency of UndoableEdit's isSignificant() Property =====

The model that categorizing by boolean isSignificant() property is broken because :

1. The isSignificant() property always returns `true`. It is actually not used.

2. It is not easy to tell when a group of edit events will finish.

3. UndoManager's lastEdit() / firstEdit() methods return null when the first/ the last edit is not significant. This causes the first edit object/the last edit object cannot be redone/undone.

4. Most undoableEdit objects are usually wrapped by DefaultDocumentEvent objects and there is no way to retrieve their edit objects inside the wrappers.  Therefore, it is impossible to group the edit events by checking their class type.

5. An idea that doing addEdit() with a dummy edit event in which the isSignificant() always returns `true` does not work because this causes a user have to invoke undo/redo twice at the first/the last edit event object.

===== An Idea to solve the Problem =====

Use CompoundEdit objects. If the routine detected an edit is started, place a 
CompoundEdit to the current UndoManager and add all events into the CompoundEdit.
This method does not require users to tell when a group ends and placing a new edit
object is suffice to work properly because doing so effectively acknowledges the
end of groups.
