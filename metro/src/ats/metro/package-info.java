/**
 * Metro is a framework which sends/receives MIDI messages via JACK Audio
 * Connection Kit. The major strength of Metro is that it is designed to compose
 * music on-the-fly. JACK processes MIDI data per a frame; the client
 * applications are required to split all data down to small chunks. Metro
 * provides a mechanism to buffer the client MIDI data and send it to JACK
 * frame-by-frame.
 * 
 * Metro also provides a mechanism to compose/decompose MIDI messages.
